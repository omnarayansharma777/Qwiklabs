# Google Cloud Platform Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Overview

1. **IAM** lets you access cloud resources that you actually need and prevents access to other resources.
2. **IAM** follows the least privilege principle, meaning nobody should have more permissions than they actually need.
3. Do not give permissions directly to end users. Instead, group permissions into roles and grant them to authenticated principals (members).
4. **Authentication** (verifying user identity) -> **Authorization** (granting resource access).

## Principals

1. Google Accounts
2. Service Accounts
3. Google Groups
4. Google Workspace Accounts (formerly G Suite Accounts)
5. Cloud Identity Domain
6. All Authenticated Users
7. All Users

## Roles

    - Viewer
    - Editor
    - Owner
    - Billing Admin
2. **Predefined**
3. **Custom**
