Bigtable is Google's fully managed, scalable NoSQL database service. 
Bigtable is ideal for storing large amounts of data in a key-value store and for use cases 
such as personalization, ad tech, financial tech, digital media, and Internet of Things (IoT). 
Bigtable supports high read and write throughput at low latency for fast access to large amounts of data for processing and analytics.

In general,you utilize less than 70% of disk storage in a cluster.
For latency-sensitive applications,storage utilization per node remain below 60%

To apply node autoscaling to the cluster
gcloud bigtable clusters update CLUSTER_ID --instance=INSTANCE_ID --autoscaling-min-nodes=1 --autoscaling-max-nodes=3 --autoscaling-cpu-target=60
