Bigtable is Google's fully managed, scalable NoSQL database service. 
Bigtable is ideal for storing large amounts of data in a key-value store and for use cases such as personalization, ad tech, financial tech, digital media, and Internet of Things (IoT). 
Bigtable supports high read and write throughput at low latency for fast access to large amounts of data for processing and analytics.
